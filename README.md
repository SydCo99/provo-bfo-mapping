# provo-bfo-mapping
Working project mapping the Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) onto BFO. The main file can be found at provo-bfo-mapping.owl, with the original PROVO file and BFO file also available in this repo for convenience. 

## Notes
The object properties are just placeholders at the moment. They only contain the labels of PROVO object properties, with no additional information. The IRIs for those object properties are also temporary placeholders and not accurate to their PROVO IRIs.
