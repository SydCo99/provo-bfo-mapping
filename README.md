# provo-bfo-mapping
Working project mapping the Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) onto BFO 

## Notes
The object properties are just placeholders at the moment. They only contain the labels of PROVO object properties, with no additional information. The IRIs for those object properties are also temporary placeholders and not accurate to their PROVO IRIs.
